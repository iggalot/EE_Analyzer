Items to add to this project: (* - "AutoCAD COMMAND") -- (*) = completed () - in process
=============================
COMPLETED
---------
(* - EER) Create rafters for regions by clicking polyline boundary
(* - ERD) Redraw drawing from file and recreate model dictionaries
(* - ENB) Add new beam to layout.  Automatically create connections with existing trimmed rafters in drawing.  Assigns connections to rafters and support beams.
(* - EEC) Perform support calculations of rafters.
(* - EEAFD) Add a foundation support to a registered object (rafter or beam) at the clicked point. Adds connections to appropriate tables and saves data to files.
( - EEAUL) Add a uniform live load to a beam or rafter


TODO
---------
( ) - Add a single full length, uniform load by clicking on the member (beams or rafters).  Need to come up with a mechanism for inputting the values for the loads.
(*) - Add a foundation support to a registered object (rafter or beam) at the clicked point.
- Add a NOT COMPUTED designator for elements that are not computed -- other than the highlight color.
- Add multiple uniform loads to same member -- need to verify load id's are unique for the member.
- Add any point loads to rafter support reaction calculations
- Perform support calculations of supporting beams
- Require all supported objects to be statically determinate and have computed reactions being supported by it?
- Allow beams to support other beams? -- How to avoid circular supporting?  (beam 1 supports 2 which supports 3 which supports 1)
- Find object in drawing by ID. -- zoom feature
(*) - use XDATA to assign object id number to the object within the drawing?
- Add rafter(s) or member(s) after its support has been drawn -- how to make the auto connections and update the files?
- Make application persistent -- always running -- would help with constant reading of files being required before every command.
- Add single items to layout outside of EER command. How to create connections with beams / walls that are already existing?
- Add ceiling / floor joist items.
- Add wall items
- Add column objects
- Compute reactions of support beams, walls, rafters, and walls.
- Draw compute status for wall / beam objects
- Add object for foundation connections (structural boundary condition).
- Remove single rafters / beams / walls/ purlins from layout
- Draw purlins.
- Draw loads - uniform and concentrated
- Add concentrated loads to members / walls that have already been drawn.  Update support calculations.
- Compute beam sizes.  
- Compute rafter sizes.
- Compute column sizes.
- Deleting beams / Removing models from layout
- Deleting walls / Removing models from layout
- Deleting loads / Removing models from layout
- Deleting connections / Removing models from layout




FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------
- Maintain a persistent list of objects that are non-determinate?  Click on item in list will zoom to member directly in AutoCAD?
- Database interface instead of text files?
- Draw structure in 3D?
- Export model to structural analysis routine
- MTO values
- Shear walls
