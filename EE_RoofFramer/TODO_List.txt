Items to add to this project: (* - "AutoCAD COMMAND") -- (*) = completed () - in process
=============================
COMPLETED COMMANDS
------------------
(* - ECRL) (C)reate (R)after (L)ayout for regions by clicking polyline boundary
(* - ERDA) (R)edraw (D)rawing (A)LL from file and recreate model dictionaries
(* - EANB) (A)dd (N)ew (B)eam to layout.  Automatically create connections with existing trimmed rafters in drawing.  Assigns connections to rafters and support beams.
(* - EPRC) (P)erform (R)eaction (c)alculations of rafters.
(* - EAFS) (A)dd (F)oundation (S)upport to a registered object (rafter or beam) at the clicked point. Adds connections to appropriate tables and saves data to files.
(* - EAFUL) (A)dd (F)ull (U)niform (L)oad to a beam or rafter
(* - EAPL) (A)dd (P)oint (L)oad to a beam or rafters


COMPLETED TODO TASK
--------------
(7/22/2022) - Add point loads to beams and rafters that have already been drawn		
(7/22/2022) - Add full uniform loads to beams and rafters that have already been drawn
(7/22/2022) - Draw foundation supports
(7/22/2022) - Draw applied loads - uniform and concentrated
(7/22/2022) - Add object for foundation connections (structural boundary condition).
(7/21/2022) - Create a main application for the modules.
(7/21/2022) - Create a module for framer application
(7/21/2022) - Add a foundation support to a registered object (rafter or beam) at the clicked point.
(7/20/2022) - use XDATA to assign object id number to the object within the drawing?

TODO
---------
- Add input values mechanism for point loads and uniform loads. Need to come up with a mechanism for inputting the values for the loads.
- Add a NOT COMPUTED designator for elements that are not computed -- other than the highlight color.
- Add multiple uniform loads to same member -- need to verify load id's are unique for the member.
- Add any point loads to rafter support reaction calculations
- Perform support calculations of supporting beams - Require all supported objects to be statically determinate and have computed reactions being supported by it?
- Allow beams to support other beams? -- How to avoid circular supporting?  (beam 1 supports 2 which supports 3 which supports 1)
- Find object in drawing by ID. -- zoom feature
- Add rafter(s) or member(s) after its support has been drawn -- how to make the auto connections and update the files?
- Make application persistent -- always running -- would help with constant reading of files being required before every command.
- Add single items to layout outside of EER command. How to create connections with beams / walls that are already existing?
- Add ceiling / floor joist items - similar to rafters.
- Add wall items
- Add column objects
- Compute reactions of support beams, walls, rafters, and walls.
- Draw status for beam objects
- Draw status for rafter objects
- Draw status for wall objects
- Remove single rafters / beams / walls/ purlins from layout
- Add purlins.
- Add uniform load that is not full length
- Compute beam sizes.  
- Compute rafter sizes.
- Compute column sizes.
- Deleting beams / Removing models from layout
- Deleting walls / Removing models from layout
- Deleting loads / Removing models from layout
- Deleting connections / Removing models from layout

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------
- Create a module for the foundation application- Create a module for the foundation application
- Maintain a persistent list of objects that are non-determinate?  Click on item in list will zoom to member directly in AutoCAD?
- Database interface instead of text files?
- Draw structure in 3D?
- Export model to structural analysis routine
- MTO values
- Shear walls
